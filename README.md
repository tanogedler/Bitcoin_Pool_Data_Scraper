# Bitcoin_Pool_Data_Scraper
Scraper of Bitcoin transaction data, as hashrate and profit in terms of BTC


Here we have a Python script that collects from several mining pools the data about hashrate and profit. The profit is the actual profit in terms of BTC. 


Any data from the available APIs can be easily added to the script, and other pools as well. Feel free to use this, and modify as you like.
